        "The PGCert offers **full-time** and **part-time** programmes. \nThe full-time PGCertInfoTech programme is quite intensive and fast-moving.\n\n\nIf you’re completely new to programming, you might want to consider the part-time programme as it offers more time to grasp key concepts. That said, the PGCertInfoTech doesn’t assume prior knowledge – but it does require a committed approach.                                                                                                                                                   Since the part-time delivery is evening-based, it’s suited to students who wish to keep their day jobs while they study."
